# ðŸŽ‰ Email Functionality Implementation Complete!

## What Has Been Implemented

I've successfully implemented a complete email system for the NexCharge platform that handles corporate admin application approval/rejection emails. Here's what's now working:

### âœ… Backend Email Service (`backend/src/utils/emailService.js`)
- **Nodemailer integration** with Gmail support
- **Three email types**:
  1. **Application Confirmation** - Sent when application is submitted
  2. **Approval Email** - Sent when application is approved (includes login credentials)
  3. **Rejection Email** - Sent when application is rejected (includes feedback)
- **Professional HTML templates** with NexCharge branding
- **Error handling** and logging

### âœ… Updated Corporate Application Controller
- **Email integration** in the review process
- **Automatic credential generation** for approved users
- **Email sending** on approval/rejection

### âœ… Frontend Integration
- **Test Email button** in Admin Dashboard
- **Loading states** and user feedback
- **API integration** for testing email service

### âœ… Testing & Debugging
- **Test email endpoint** (`POST /api/corporate-applications/test-email`)
- **Command-line test script** (`npm run test:email`)
- **Comprehensive error handling**

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Configure Your Environment Variables

Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Set Up Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account â†’ Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter "NexCharge" as the name
   - Copy the 16-character password
3. **Use the App Password** in your `.env` file

### 3. Test the Email Service

#### Option A: Using the Admin Dashboard
1. Login as admin in the frontend
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Corporate Applications
3. Click the **"Test Email"** button
4. Check your inbox for the test email

#### Option B: Using Command Line
```bash
cd backend
npm run test:email
```

#### Option C: Using API Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/corporate-applications/test-email
Authorization: Bearer <your-admin-jwt-token>
```

### 4. Approve/Reject Applications

When you approve or reject a corporate application:
- **Approval**: User receives email with login credentials and dashboard access
- **Rejection**: User receives email with feedback and reapplication guidance
- **Confirmation**: User receives email when application is first submitted
